This document tracks the development progress of the application. It is divided into three sections: Completed, In Progress, and Upcoming.

## Completed

### Phase 0: Foundation & Refinement
This initial phase focused on establishing a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the application, adhering to modern best practices.

*   **1. Refactor Error Handling:** Moved from string-based error checking to custom, typed exceptions.
*   **2. Implement Automated JSON Serialization:** Used `freezed` to eliminate manual parsing.
*   **3. Integrate `go_router`:** Set up a declarative, type-safe, and authentication-aware navigation system.
*   **4. Fix Session Restore Crash:** Made the `readSession` method resilient to corrupted data in secure storage.

### Phase 1: Product Catalog
The core functionality for displaying products is complete.

*   **1. Removed Features:** Removed all search and category filtering logic to simplify the feature set.
*   **2. Implemented Pagination:** Implemented a robust infinite scroll (pagination) system.

### Phase 2: Shopping Cart
The shopping cart feature is fully implemented, demonstrating a rich domain model and robust state management.

*   **1. Domain Layer:** Implemented `Cart` and `CartItem` entities with full business logic.
*   **2. Data Layer:** Implemented a repository that uses an in-memory cache and local storage for high performance and persistence.
*   **3. Presentation Layer:** Implemented a production-ready `CartCubit` and a complete, well-designed UI in `CartPage`.
